/*
1.	Write a program that takes a positive integer n and displays the first n terms of the following series: 1, -1, 2, -3, 5, -8, 13, -21, â€¦

You need to handle cases when the user enters 0 or negative numbers by giving appropriate messages.
[25]
    Test cases:
#	INPUT	OUTPUT
1	3	1, -1, 2
2	0	N is invalid
3	10	1,-1,2,-3,5,-8,13,-21,34,-55
4	-2	N is invalid
